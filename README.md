# ROS-based-project-
a ROS-based project in Python/C++, including an action and a service related to human monitoring  project 
Project Title: Human Monitoring using ROS

Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can monitor the movements of humans in a given environment using ROS.
The system will use a camera to detect the presence of humans and will track their movements using a combination of 
computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system will include an action to start monitoring the environment, 
and a service to request the current number of humans in the environment.

Implementation:
The implementation of the project will be done using the following components:

    ROS: The project will be developed using ROS, which is an open-source framework for building robot applications.

    ROS Packages: The project will use the following ROS packages:

    a. OpenCV: To perform computer vision tasks such as object detection and tracking.

    b. TensorFlow: To perform machine learning tasks such as object classification.

    c. ROS Image: To capture and publish images from the camera.

    Action: An action server will be implemented to start monitoring the environment. The action server will take 
    no input and will start monitoring the environment when called.

    Service: A service will be implemented to request the current number of humans in the environment. The service will 
    return the current count of humans.

    Python/C++: The project will be implemented using both Python and C++. Python will be used to implement 
    the higher-level monitoring logic, while C++ will be used to implement the lower-level image processing.
